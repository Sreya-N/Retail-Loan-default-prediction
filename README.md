Predict Loan Default" is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of classification models. Techniques such as logistic regression and decision trees are employed, and model performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrices. The project serves as a practical example of applying analytics to financial risk assessment.

**Project Overview**
**The objective of this project is to:**
    Explore and clean loan data.
    Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    Build a classification model to predict the likelihood of loan default.
    Evaluate the model performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
